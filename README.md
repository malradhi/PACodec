## 📜 News
🧠 [2025.08.08] We’ve officially released the full source code for MiSTR! You can now explore, reproduce, and build on our multi-modal brain-to-speech synthesis pipeline. Check the [`src`](./src) folder for details.

🧠 [2025.5.29] We are releasing all the code to support research on accelerating MiSTR multi-modal models.

🥳 [2025.05.19, 11:54 AM CET] Our paper has been accepted to [Interspeech 2025](https://www.interspeech2025.org/home). Looking forward to seeing you in Rotterdam, The Netherlands, at the conference!

<br>
<br> 

## 💡 Highlights
1. **Multi-Modal iEEG Feature Encoding**: MiSTR introduces a wavelet-based encoder combined with prosody-aware features (pitch, energy, shimmer, duration, phase variability) to model the neural dynamics of speech production.
2. **Transformer-Based Prosody Decoder**: A novel Transformer architecture captures long-range dependencies in brain activity to predict expressive and fluent Mel spectrograms aligned with speech prosody.
3. **Neural Phase Vocoder (IHPR)**: MiSTR proposes Iterative Harmonic Phase Reconstruction (IHPR), ensuring phase continuity and harmonic consistency for high-fidelity audio synthesis without vocoder artifacts.
4. **State-of-the-Art Performance**: Achieves a Pearson correlation of 0.91, STOI of 0.73, and MOSA score of 3.38, outperforming all existing baselines in iEEG-to-speech synthesis.
5. **Clinically Inspired Design**: Designed with speech neuroprosthetics in mind, MiSTR offers a scalable, robust pipeline for restoring natural speech in individuals with severe communication impairments.
6. **Code and Samples Available**: Full implementation, pretrained models, and inference samples are provided in this GitHub repository to support reproducibility and further research.

## 🛠️ Usage

### 1. Clone the Repository and Set Up the Environment

```bash
git clone git clone https://github.com/malradhi/mistr.git
cd mistr

# Recommended: Create a clean environment
conda create -n mistr python=3.10
conda activate mistr

# Install required Python packages
pip install -r requirements.txt

```
💡 Note: Requires PyTorch ≥ 2.0 and CUDA-compatible GPU for best performance.


<br>

### 2. Feature Extraction from iEEG and Audio

```bash
python neural_signal_encoder.py

```

This will generate the following files for each participant (e.g., `sub-XX`):

- `*_feat.npy`: Wavelet + prosody features extracted from iEEG
- `*_spec.npy`: Ground-truth Mel spectrogram from original audio
- `*_prosody.npy`: Extracted prosody features (pitch, energy, shimmer, duration, phase variability)

<br>

### 3. Train the Spectrogram Mapper (Autoencoder + Transformer)

```bash
python spectrogram_mapper_transformer.py

```

This script will:

- Train a **neural autoencoder** to compress iEEG features into a compact latent space
- Use a **Transformer** to predict Mel spectrograms from the latent iEEG representations
- Generate audio waveforms from predicted and ground-truth spectrograms
- Save predicted spectrograms as `*_predicted_spec.npy`
- Save synthesized audio files:
  - `*_orig_synthesized.wav` — from original spectrogram
  - `*_predicted.wav` — from predicted spectrogram
- Save evaluation results in `temporal_attention_results.npy`


<br>

### 4. Phase-Aware Waveform Reconstruction (IHPR Vocoder)

```bash
python harmonic_phase_reconstructor.py

```

This script applies **Iterative Harmonic Phase Reconstruction (IHPR)** to refine phase and improve audio quality.

It will:

- Load predicted spectrograms (`*_predicted_spec.npy`)
- Apply harmonic-consistent phase reconstruction
- Save high-fidelity audio waveforms for each participant:
  - `*_predicted.wav` (updated)
  - `*_orig_synthesized.wav` (if regenerated)
- Output `.wav` files in the `/results/` directory


<br>

### 5. Visualization of Results

```bash
python neural_output_visualizer.py

```

This script generates high-resolution plots and visualizations:

- `results.png`: Participant-wise correlation scores
- `spec_example.png` and `.pdf`: Ground-truth vs. predicted spectrograms
- `wav_example.png` and `.pdf`: Waveform comparison of original vs. reconstructed audio
- `*_prosody_visualization.png`: Plots of extracted prosody features (if available)

All visual outputs are saved in the `/results/` directory.

```bash
./features/            # Extracted features and prosody files
./results/             # Output spectrograms, waveforms, and plots
./harmonic_phase_reconstructor.py
./neural_signal_encoder.py
./spectrogram_mapper_transformer.py
